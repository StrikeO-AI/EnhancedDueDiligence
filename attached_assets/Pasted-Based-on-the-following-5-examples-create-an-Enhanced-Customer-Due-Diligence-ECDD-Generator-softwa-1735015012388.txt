Additional Information: 
Chief Compliance Officer: "I have background to David Wright in discussion with Tim, our lawyer today 19 Dec 2024.  Tim introduced David Wright to CTG as customer and investor.  David is also Tim's client in the digital industry.  In this context, Tim has made it clear that he represents us and not David.  David's previous firm Adelphus specialised in criminal defence law which explained the 'odd' names popping up in the news.  The firm has subsequently closed down after David left the firm.  David now has his own company HR Settlement, a remittance company which remits funds from the UK to AU.  At this stage I am comfortable with Tim's explanation."
